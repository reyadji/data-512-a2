    "The goal of this assignment is to detect bias on political figures from multiple countries by analyzing of the *coverage* and the *quality* of the the politican's Wikipedia articles. The main output of this project is a data visualization of highest-ranked and lowest-ranked countries in term of politican article density. The visuals itself does not tell the entire story, but it hopefully helps uncovering political biases in Wikipedia. \n",
    "\n",
    "To support the analysis, I produce these artifacts:\n",
    "1. A CSV file with politicans Wikipedia article information (country, article name, revision ID, article quality, and population of the country)\n",
    "2. A Jupyter notebook with all the code\n",
    "3. A comprehensive README file\n",
    "4. A MIT LICENSE file\n",
    "5. A visualization png file\n",

    "3. Article quality prediction by Wikimedia ORES machine learning service\n",

    "The 10 lowest-ranked country in terms of number of politician articles as a proportion of country population in Wikipedia is dominated by countries with big population (China, India, Indonesia) or by countries where English-speaking editors are less familiar with, such as Bangladesh, Zambia or by countries with closed political system, like North Korea. On the other hand, the top 10 country in terms of number of politician articles as a proportion of country population consists exclusively of countries with very small population. While this metric sheds a light on  bias against politicians from less-familiar countries in Wikipedia, I found the metric/analysis itself has inherently flawed against countries with big population and vice versa. It is by no means an indication that English-speaking Wikipedia biased against China, India, and Indonesia. Afterall, China(1138 articles), India(990 articles), and Indonesia(215 articles) have decent number of total articles in English Wikipedia, and there is no linear correlation between total number of articles and population.\n",

    "### number of high-quality articles as a proportion of all articles about politicians from that country\n",
    "The second metric filters out \"placeholder\" and \"empty calories\" articles about politicians to reduce the noise. The hypotheses is biases would be more pronounced when there is only a handful relevant articles. However, there is no obvious bias against the lowest-ranked countries in this metric (excluding 39 countries without good or featured article). It consists of countries from 4 different continents with various population (Nigeria has the largest population, tiny Luxembourg has the smalles one), developed economically (Finland, Luxembourg) or developing economically (Nigeria, Czech Republic). The only similarities among these countries is English is not the primary or even secondary everyday language. The other end of the spectrum also shows very little bias. Although United States is in the top 10, it does not even have the highest proportion of well-written articles to all articles. That distinction surprisingly belongs to North Korea by a wide margin!! 9 out of 39 articles about the Hermit Kingdom's politicians are deemed good or featured article. It is even more surprising considering North Korea is in the bottom 10 of number of politician articles as proportion of country population since there is not that many articles. I am under the impression that a North Korean politic expert (or a group of researchers) is dedicated to write most, if not all, of North Korea politician articles. A cursory glance at the articles' edit history confirm that WIkiproject North Korea makes significant contribution to the North Korean-related Wikipedia articles.\n",
